# Career-Prediction-System-AI

The repository contains an interactive Career Prediction system created using Prolog along with a Natural Language Interface to the system made using python.

The Prediction system here refers to a system that will take all inputs and then suggest to the graduating BTech students a list of choices with some ranking. The system would first ask general questions and take user inputs. After this , the system will ask branch specific questions and then rank careers based on your choices.

The natural language interface is designed in Python which will provide inputs to the Career Prediction system developed in Prolog.
